# Data Structures 2

## Trees

  * Hierarchical data structure where the information is represented in the form of parent and children i.e represented as a set of linked nodes.
  * The children of each node could be accessed by traversing the tree until the specific value is reached.
  * Advantages
    * Trees with ordering provide moderate access/search speed (quicker than Linked List).
    * Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion speed (quicker than Arrays).
  * Examples: File System Structure, HTML DOM Structure, Router Algorithm.
  * Terminology
    * Root
    * Parent Node
    * Child Node
    * Siblings
    * Leaf Node
    * Internal Node
    * External Node
    * Degree (no. of children)
    * Level (each step from top to bottom)
    * Height (no. of edges from leaf to some node)
    * Depth (no. of edges from root to some node)
    * Path
